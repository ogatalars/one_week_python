# Functions are reusable actions that have a name.
# # Functions are defined with the def keyword.
# KEEP CODE DRY, Function help us abstract away code, breaking a complex program dowm into small pieces
# define -> Before we can use a function, we must define it and give it a name.
# Execute -> once python knows about our function, we can call it anytime
