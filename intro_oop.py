# A way of organizing code 
# Object oriented programming (OOP) is an approach to programming that involves modeling 'things' into Python objects. 
# These objects can contain both data and functionality all wrapped up together into a reusable component. 
# Chess -> Board, piece, player, AIPlayer, match. 

# Class -> classes are blueprints or recipes that we can later use to create objects from. A class drescribes what properties and functionaklity a particular object will contain or have. 
# Instance -> We call the individual objects that are created from a class.
